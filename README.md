# 📣 Project: Do you know me? CLI Quiz App

## 🙇🏻‍♂️ Description

- This is a CLI quiz app that will ask you questions about me (Milind Mishra).
- I have hard-coded the questions and answers in the script.

```javascript
// Creating the questions array
const questions = [
  "What is my name? ",
  "Where do I live? ",
  "What is my favourite color? ",
  "What is my favourite food? ",
  "What is my favourite programming language? ",
];

// Creating the answers array
const answers = ["Milind", "Dhanbad", "Black", "Pizza", "JavaScript"];
```

## 🤔 How to use it

- Clone the repository and first run the command `npm install`
- After that you can install it globally by running `npm install -g .` when you are in the root directory of the repository.
- Run the command `markOne` to start the quiz.
